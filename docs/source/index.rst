Welcome to the Installies documentation!
========================================

Installies is a site for managing, organizing, and retrieving shell scripts for
use to install, remove, update or compile apps on linux. This is the documentation
on how to use Installies.

Installies is free (as in freedom) and open-source software, which means you are completely
free to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software.
